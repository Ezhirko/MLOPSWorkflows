# Simple CNN Model CICD Pipeline ðŸš€

This repository contains a lightweight PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification. The model achieves over **95% accuracy in just 1 epoch**, has fewer than **25,000 parameters**, and includes **image augmentation** for better generalization.

The project is integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration, ensuring the following conditions are tested and verified:

1. The model has fewer than 25,000 parameters.
2. The model achieves over 95% accuracy in 1 epoch.
3. Additional relevant tests ensure robustness.

## Features

- **Lightweight Model:** The CNN has fewer than 25,000 parameters, making it efficient for resource-constrained environments.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves over 95% training accuracy in just one epoch.
- **Image Augmentation:** Techniques like random rotation, shifts, and flips are applied to enhance dataset variability.
- **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions pipeline automatically tests the model's compliance with requirements.
- **Automated Testing:** Includes unit tests for parameters, output probabilities, and input compatibility.

## GitHub Actions Workflow
The repository is integrated with GitHub Actions. The workflow tests:

1. **Model parameters:** Ensures the total number of parameters is below the limit.
2. **Training accuracy:** Confirms training accuracy is 95% or higher in one epoch.
3. **Additional tests:** Includes unique tests for model output probabilities, input compatibility, and more.
### Unique Tests
- **Parameter Count Test:** Verifies the model has fewer than 25,000 parameters.
- **Training Accuracy Test:** Ensures the model achieves over 95% training accuracy in one epoch.
- **Output Probability Test:** Confirms the model outputs valid probability distributions (sum to 1, non-negative).
- **Input Compatibility Test:** Validates that the model handles MNIST-sized inputs (28x28 grayscale images).
- **Output Shape Test:** Checks that the final layer has 10 units (one for each digit).
